## Projects
### Bachelor thesis

Title: Short-term Photovoltaic Power Forecasting using Deep Learning

In this thesis, i developed a **Deep Learning model** for short-term PV power forecasting. The model, an end-to-end CNN-MLP hybrid network, takes a sky image, PV historical data, and other data as input, to predict future power values for a 15-minute forecast period.

High-level overview of the model:

For Training and Evaluation of the Deep Learning model, a dataset comprised of sky images and PV power values was created using cost-effective software and hardware components such as a **Raspberry Pi**.


### Benchmark model implementation 
[GitHub-repo](https://github.com/Felix561/smart-persistence-model)

I created a **Python implementation** of the Smart Persistence Model (SPM) to serve as a benchmark model for the short-term PV power forecasting problem.
